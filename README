Union of Two Convex Polygons

Union of Two Convex Polygons Evaluator with a PostScript File Generator

Features
    This python script computes the union of two 2D convex polygons.
    
    - Input: Two polygons in a PostScript file.
    - Output: A PostScript file with the generated convex polygon.

Environment
    - Language: Python 3
    - OS: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
    - Interpreter: Python interpreter

Usage
    Running the Script
        1. Clone or download the script with example inputs into local machine
        2. Open terminal with directory containing the script
        3. Run the script with the following structure:
            ./CG_hw5 -f filename
        
        *You can replace 'filename' with desired value*

    Arguments
        - '-f filename': The file containing the two polygons

    Output
        The script prints a standard out version of the PostScript file and can generate a separate Postscript file which is placed within the same directory as script.

Examples
    1. This command evaluates the union of two convex polygons using the default input file, meaning the program will take polygons from the default PostScript file 'HW5_a_in.ps'. It will print to standard out:

        ./CG_hw5 -f filename

    2. This command evaluates the union of two convex polygons using the polygons from 'input_polygons.ps'. The output will be saved to a file called 'my_polygon.ps':

        ./CG_hw5 -f input_polygons.ps > my_polygon.ps
